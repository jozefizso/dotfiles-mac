## Getting Started

Run the `bootstrap.sh` script to setup `brew` and `nvm`.

The script will automatically run `brew bundle` to install all applications.

When using `oh-my-zsh` setup the autocompletions with:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```
